Creating a Story Dashboard for NYC Citi Bike data

# There and Back - A Cyclists Trail

The bottom line for any company is to evaluate its profitability. While this data does not include monetary values, the usage numbers may indicate Citi Bike’s success. The focus of this analysis is to evaluate the age and user type of New York City bicyclists. Citi Bike users are either Customers with a 24 hour or 3 day pass, or Subscribers with an annual pass. 

It is important to note that from this data it was not possible to get an exact count of customers or subscribers, as an individual most likely took multiple trips. The totals for the first month in operation (June 2013) and the most recent month (October 2020) are the number of trips taken by each user category, rather than the exact count of each type.

A preliminary review of the data showed that some patrons recorded an incorrect year of birth.  However, my grandfather road the Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic (200 mile, 2 day event) up into his 70’s. In light of that, 1930 was chosen as the earliest year a patron could be born.

Trip data from the NYC Citi Bike program has been collected since its inception in June 2013. This analysis looks at the current year 2020 which is still in progress, so there are only 10 months of complete data. The current year is of particular interest as the country has spent most of it under COVID-19 pandemic restriction, and NYC the hardest hit. 

## Subscriber Trip Time

The correlation between higher trips counts and lower trip times is a good indication that subscribers use this program to commute to work. Subscriber usage took a dramatic fall in April 2020, which would also correlate to the “lockdown” that started mid March. Though the number of trips fell, the average trip time did not change all that much, another indication that most subcribers could making the same daily trips. Customer trip duration increased during the same time period. In spite of the hit, by September subscriber trips almost doubled since January. It seems that using Citi Bike was preferable to public transportation. 

## Trips Taken by Age

The vast majority of New York City is less that 45 years old. Grouped by age, ridership is highest between 25-34. However, individual cyclists who are 51 take the most trips. There is also a spike in trip length for the same age. Notably, one-fifth of both the top starting and ending stations are in close proximity to a significant population of persons near 50. All the other top stations are near small pockets of those 50 years or above.

This finding may be useful for targeting ads to a certain demographic. For example, persons around the age of 50 are more likely have children that would be influenced by their parents usage of Citi Bike, thereby increasing ridership.
